This drawer slides between the Y axis and the right hand horizontal extrusions, it is supported on both sides. When closed the front of the drawer is level with the end of the right extrusion, when opened it is level with the end of the Y axis extrusion.

You just need to temporarily remove the control panel to slide the draw in. When refitted the panel stops the drawer from pulling right out.
Owners of later Ender 3's with the double sided tensioner may find it a little trickier to fit the drawer, however there should be enough flex in the model without removing the tensioner.

The drawer has a cut down front so you can access the bed adjuster on the fly and has a stopper on the back to allow plenty of room for the control panel cable as well as other cables (eg: SD card extension).

There 2 versions, one with a divider, one without.

Modelled in Sketchup, with 1.6mm walls and bottom, but I've included the SKP files if you wish to make them a bit stiffer or do any other changes - you can export as an STL with the free extension from the Warehouse.
